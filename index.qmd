Hi, I’m Illona Nasywa Hannum but you can just call me Lona!
I’m currently studying Information Systems at ITB, and I really enjoy exploring how technology can make life simpler and more thoughtful.

People often say I think too much, but honestly, that’s my favorite part about myself. I like observing little details, from the way someone types to how a story unfolds, because I believe everything tells something if you pay enough attention.

When I’m not coding or writing, I love listening to music, daydreaming about ideas, or watching videos that somehow lead me into another curiosity rabbit hole.
